//! A union-find data structure contains a partition of a
//! contiguous bounded set of integers. It supports two operations.
//! The *union* operation merges two partitions. The *find* operation
//! identifies the partition containing an element by returning a
//! "canonical" element of the partition as a label. Both operations
//! are fast.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ```
//! use union_find::UnionFind;
//! const N: usize = 20;
//! 
//! let mut parity = UnionFind::new(N);
//! for i in 0..N {
//!     if i & 1 == 0 {
//!         parity.union(0, i)
//!     } else {
//!         parity.union(1, i)
//!     }
//! };
//! for i in 0..N {
//!     let c = parity.find(i);
//!     assert_eq!(c, i & 1)
//! }
